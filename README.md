Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/GeoffStorbeck/full/RPbGxZ/.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

Rule #3: Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

User Story: As a user, I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.

Bonus User Story: As a user, I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.

Bonus User Story: As a user, I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
